## üìò Assignment description



### üîß Assignment 1 

The first part of Assignment 1 is to use 3 numerical method (Euler velocity verlet and Runge Ketta method to calculate the orbit of the Earth, we would like to see which method can have a high precision to complete one orbit. The introduction of the method are written as follow:

- Euler‚Äôs Method (The first order forward differentiation)
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

The update rule is given by:

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(t_n, y_n)
$$

Where:
- \( y_n \) is the approximation of the solution at time \( t_n \),
- \( h \) is the time step size,
- \( f(t_n, y_n) \) is the derivative evaluated at \( (t_n, y_n) \).

- Velocity Verlet method

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n + v_n h + \frac{1}{2} a_n h^2
$$

$$
a_{n+1} = a(x_{n+1}, t_{n+1})
$$

$$
v_{n+1} = v_n + \frac{1}{2} (a_n + a_{n+1}) h
$$

$$
k_1 = f(t_n, y_n)
$$

$$
k_2 = f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_1\right)
$$

$$
k_3 = f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_2\right)
$$

$$
k_4 = f(t_n + h, y_n + hk_3)
$$

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
$$
