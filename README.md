## üìò Assignment description



## üîß Assignment 1 

The first part of Assignment 1 is to use 3 numerical method (Euler velocity verlet and Runge Ketta method to calculate the orbit of the Earth. The fundamental procedure of the method is given the initial boundary condition and calculate the next iternation data, we would like to see which method can have a high precision to complete one orbit. The introduction of the method are written as follow:

- Euler‚Äôs Method (The first order forward differentiation)
  
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

The update rule is given by:

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(t_n, y_n)
$$

- Velocity Verlet method

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n + v_n h + \frac{1}{2} a_n h^2
$$

$$
a_{n+1} = a(x_{n+1}, t_{n+1})
$$

$$
v_{n+1} = v_n + \frac{1}{2} (a_n + a_{n+1}) h
$$

- Runge-Kutta Methods (RK4)

$$
k_1 = f(t_n, y_n)
$$

$$
k_2 = f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_1\right)
$$

$$
k_3 = f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_2\right)
$$

$$
k_4 = f(t_n + h, y_n + hk_3)
$$

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
$$

By comparsion, Runge Kutta method perform the grestest performence, since the Runge Kutta method has the lowest trancation error among those method under the same iteration time step. 

The latter part give the proof of Kepler's second law, which state that the Sun sweeps equal areas of space during equal time intervals as the planet orbits. If we express it in equation: 

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}rv
$$

In the code, we prove that each second of 1/2 rv result respond to similar value, which means that there are similar ratio of dA/dt, which prove the Kelper's second law.

## üîß Assignment 2

The aim of this assignment is to compare 3 different relaxiation method to solve the Poisson equation (potential problem), and use Lax and Lax-Wendroff method to solve space-time PDE.

## Poisson Equation 
The 3 numerical method I introduce here follow the grid (lattice) updated structure, which means that each updated point will appear 4 nearest neighbour.

Jacobi Relaxation 

$$
\phi(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{2d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \left( \phi(\vec{r} + h \vec{e}_i) + \phi(\vec{r} - h \vec{e}_i) \right) + \frac{h^2}{2d \varepsilon_0} \rho(\vec{r})
$$

Jacobi Relaxation method update the iteration using the current 4 neighbour, the below is the pseudocode for Jocobi Relaxation.

FUNCTION JacobiRelaxation(bound):
    iter ‚Üê 0
    potential_current ‚Üê initial potential (copy)

    DO:
        iter ‚Üê iter + 1
        potential_new ‚Üê copy of potential_current

        FOR i from 1 to N-2:
            FOR j from 1 to N-2:
                left  ‚Üê i - h
                right ‚Üê i + h
                down  ‚Üê j - h
                up    ‚Üê j + h

                potential_new[i, j] ‚Üê (1 / (2 √ó d)) √ó (
                                          potential_current[i, up] +
                                          potential_current[i, down] +
                                          potential_current[right, j] +
                                          potential_current[left, j]
                                      ) + (h¬≤ / (2 √ó d √ó Œµ)) √ó charge_density[i - N/2, j - N/2]

        max_delta ‚Üê maximum absolute difference between potential_new and potential_current

        potential_current ‚Üê copy of potential_new

    WHILE max_delta > bound

    RETURN iter, potential_new








## üîß Assignment 3

- The follow approach tried to solve the time-independent schrodinger equation.

Wavefunction Representation and Hamiltonian Matrix

 Wavefunction vector:

$$
\Psi =
\begin{pmatrix}
\psi(1) \\
\psi(2) \\
\psi(3) \\
\vdots \\
\psi(N-1) \\
\psi(N)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

With boundary conditions:

$$
\psi(0) = \psi(N+1) = 0
$$

---

Matrices:

**Matrix A:**

$$
\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{h^2} \left( \mathbb{I}_{-1} - 2\mathbb{I}_0 + \mathbb{I}_1 \right)
$$

**Matrix B:**

$$
\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{12} \left( \mathbb{I}_{-1} + 10\mathbb{I}_0 + \mathbb{I}_1 \right)
$$

**Potential matrix \( \nu \):**

$$
\nu =
\begin{pmatrix}
\nu_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & \nu_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & 0 & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & \nu_N
\end{pmatrix}
$$

---

Hamiltonian Equation:

$$
\left( -\frac{1}{\gamma^2} \mathbf{B}^{-1} \mathbf{A} + \nu \right) \Psi = \epsilon \Psi
$$

---


We apply the modified Hamiltonain to find out the eigenvalue of the wavefunction, which the eigenvalue is the energy itself. 

The latter part of assignment 3, we use the Crank-Nicolson Scheme to compete the schrodinger equation (PDE).


Consider the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(t, x) = H(x) \psi(t, x)
$$

---

Using the **Crank‚ÄìNicolson scheme**, the equation can be written as:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\psi_r^{n+1} - \psi_r^n}{\tau} = \sum_{s=1}^{N} H_{r,s} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( \psi_s^n + \psi_s^{n+1} \right)
$$

---

With:

$$
H_{r,s} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \cdot \frac{\delta_{r+1,s} + \delta_{r-1,s} - 2\delta_{r,s}}{h^2} + V(x_r)\delta_{r,s}
$$

---

Further:

$$
\psi^{n+1} = \left( 1 + \frac{i\tau}{2\hbar} H \right)^{-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i\tau}{2\hbar} H \right) \psi^n
$$

---

Initial condition:

$$
\psi(t = 0, x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma_0 \sqrt{2\pi}}} e^{ik_0(x - x_0)} e^{-\frac{(x - x_0)^2}{2\sigma_0^2}}
$$

Which the hamiltonian can written as:

$$
H_{r,s} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \cdot \frac{\delta_{r+1,s} + \delta_{r-1,s} - 2\delta_{r,s}}{h^2} + V(r)\delta_{r,s}
$$

We can find out the list of all psi, then we can plot the probability distribution of the system which is the square term of psi.

## Assignment 4

The Hamiltonian is:

### üîß Action of \( H \) on Basis States

$$
H \left| \uparrow \uparrow \right\rangle = \frac{J}{4} \left| \uparrow \uparrow \right\rangle
$$

$$
H \left| \downarrow \downarrow \right\rangle = \frac{J}{4} \left| \downarrow \downarrow \right\rangle
$$

$$
H \left| \uparrow \downarrow \right\rangle  
= \frac{J}{2} \left| \downarrow \uparrow \right\rangle - \frac{J}{4} \left| \uparrow \downarrow \right\rangle
$$

$$
H \left| \downarrow \uparrow \right\rangle  
= \frac{J}{2} \left| \uparrow \downarrow \right\rangle - \frac{J}{4} \left| \downarrow \uparrow \right\rangle
$$

---

### üìê Matrix Elements

\langle \uparrow \uparrow | H | \uparrow \uparrow \rangle = \frac{J}{4}
\qquad
\langle \downarrow \downarrow | H | \downarrow \downarrow \rangle = \frac{J}{4}
$$

$$
\langle \uparrow \downarrow | H | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle = -\frac{J}{4}
\qquad
\langle \downarrow \uparrow | H | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle = -\frac{J}{4}
$$

$$
\langle \uparrow \downarrow | H | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle = \frac{J}{2}
\qquad
\langle \downarrow \uparrow | H | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle = \frac{J}{2}
$$

---

### üßæ Hamiltonian Matrix


The matrix form of H is:

$$
H = J \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -\frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{4} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4}
\end{pmatrix}
$$




Exact diagonalization is a specific approach that to find out the eigenvalue of each spin operator and they manifest in the Hamililtonian matrix. We find out the eigenvalue of the Hamililtonian matrix which corrspond to the energy density function to Henserberg model. This method is only cater for specific model like Hensenberg model which the Hamilitonian matrix can be block-diagonlized and the Hamilitonian is symmetric. 

We make use of exact diagonlization to calculate the ground state energy of a 10 x 10 Henserberg model. 

The latter part of the Assignment is to calculate the Renyi Entropy and von Neumann entropy for N=10.


The equation of Renyi Entropy is:

$$
S_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{1 - n} \ln \left( \mathrm{Tr} \left( \rho_A^n \right) \right).
$$

While the von Neumann entropy is:

$$
S_A^{\mathrm{vN}} = -\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_A \ln \rho_A)
$$

The code in my assignment follow the construction of the equation. For the reduced density matrix, it is the dot product of the eigenvector of Hamiltonian Matrix, the code have shown that there is a 10x10 reduced density matrix nad plug in the fomula to calculate the Renyi and von Neumann entropy. The graph of the diestribution of the entropy is also shown in the source code.
